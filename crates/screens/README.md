## About the bird

"Like all bowerbirds, the satin bowerbird shows highly complex courtship behaviour. ... Males build specialised stick structures, called bowers, which they decorate with blue, yellow, and shiny objects, including berries, flowers, snail shells, and plastic items such as ballpoint pens, drinking straws and clothes pegs." ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin_bowerbird))
